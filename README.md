Strava CLI

This is a CLI tool to get the most recent activity from Strava.

## Setup

You will need a strava account. Because I already have an app associated with my account and it's not this app, I used my partner's account to create the app.

## Steps

1. Go to https://www.strava.com/settings/connections
2. Click "Create App"
3. Enter the required information
